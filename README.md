# FLIGHT-SIMULATOR-WITH-RASPBERRY
## Introduce
Flight simulators can provide a cost-effective and safe way for aspiring pilots, aviation enthusiasts, or pilots-in-training to experience the thrill of flight and practice their skills. The use of computer-generated graphics and hardware components can offer a highly realistic experience, allowing users to train and learn in a controlled environment. Additionally, simulators also offer the ability to practice complex flight scenarios and emergencies, which can be difficult to replicate in real life.
